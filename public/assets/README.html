<h1>About the assets/project directory</h1>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Add custom assets in the <code>src/assets/project</code> directory <strong>NOT</strong> directly into <code>src/assets</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>/src/assets/css</code>, <code>/src/assets/fonts</code>, <code>/src/assets/img</code>, and <code>/src/assets/js</code> directories created when you run <code>npm run init</code> are used by USWDS only. They have this special pathing to allow easier copy/pasting of components from the USWDS site, and are ignored by git.</p>
<p>Include any custom assets you need in the <code>src/assets/project</code> directory, like <code>/assets/project/img/my-cool-image.jpg</code>. This assures that custom assets aren't ignored by git or overridden by USWDS.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
